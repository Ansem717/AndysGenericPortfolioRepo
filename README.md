# Andy's Generic Portfolio Repo
### So many private repos...
I've been needing to do this for so long. Throughout my many educational adventures, I've practiced and implemented a myriad of programming techniques and tricks, but they were all in private repos for that school! 
I was just so comfortable with making my code private so no one would pick apart the silly coding failures I'm afraid to admit.
However, it's come to my attention lately, that I don't have a lot to show off. So I've decided to make a public sandbox to act as my portfolio, where I'll just put a bunch of public code here.
### Multiple Repos
Yeah, multiple repos would probably be smart but I'm too lazy to move five files. :)
